--🧠 Anomaly Detection in Time Series Data
Welcome to Anomaly Detection in Time Series Data – a cutting-edge platform for real-time anomaly detection in time series datasets.

This powerful tool leverages Machine Learning (Isolation Forest) and Deep Learning (LSTM) to detect abnormal behaviors in data, helping organizations stay ahead of critical events. Featuring a sleek, interactive web interface built with Flask, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript, this solution is optimized for accuracy, performance, and scalability.

🚀 Key Features
📈 Intelligent Detection Algorithms
Detects anomalies using:

Isolation Forest: A lightweight, tree-based anomaly detection algorithm.

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): A deep learning network ideal for sequential data.

⏱ Real-Time Monitoring
Continuously tracks and visualizes incoming data streams with immediate anomaly detection.

🖥 Modern Web Interface
A fully responsive dashboard designed using Flask and JavaScript for seamless user interaction.

💾 Model Persistence
Trained models are saved using Joblib, allowing for fast reuse without retraining.

☁️ AWS-Ready
Easily deploy the app to AWS for scalable, production-ready anomaly detection.
